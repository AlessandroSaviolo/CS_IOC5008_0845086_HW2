# Generative Adversarial Network using CelebA Dataset

This project is part of a series of projects for the course _Selected Topics in Visual Recognition using Deep Learning_ that I attended during my exchange program at National Chiao Tung University (Taiwan). See `task.pdf` for the details of the assignment. See `report.pdf` for the report containing the representation and the analysis of the produced results.

The purpose of this project is to implement a Generative Adversarial Network using the famous CelebA Dataset and use the final model to generate [500 celebrity faces](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qaWmdfAYIBWISdVZX5Zsywh7vnQI4Vm1).

## 1. Dataset

- [CelebA Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

## 2. Project Structure

See `GANcelebA.ipynb` for all the details about the implementation of the GAN model.

## 3. Examples of Generated Faces
